The `Index.tsx` file already contains a basic \"Hello, World!\" page. Here's what's currently in place:\n\n```jsx\n// File: src/pages/Index.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst Index = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-white\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-4xl font-bold text-black\">Hello, World!</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Index;\n```\n\nThis code creates a simple page with \"Hello, World!\" centered on a white background. It's already as simple and straightforward as it can be for a \"Hello, World!\" page.\n\nSince the requested feature is already implemented, no changes are needed to the codebase. The existing page meets the requirement of a simple \"Hello, World!\" page without any additional description."
